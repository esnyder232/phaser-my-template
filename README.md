# phaser-my-template
A template repo for my tutorials. I got tired of copying one of my tutorials and deleting all the assets/scenes in it. So this is a template I can quickly copy and paste from.

To use this repo:
 - git clone
 - npm install
 - open up in visual studio code
 - hit F5 (or in a cmd line "npm run dev")
 - open up a browser, go to http://localhost:8080
 - open up the console, there should be the messages in the consolw for function calls on "simple-scene"

 Once you confirm all above is working, you can start using this as a beginning template for phaser stuff.
 If you want to find all instances of "template", look for "phaser-my-template" and replace it with whatever you want.
